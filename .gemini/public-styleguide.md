# Public Portfolio Content Standards (richardspicer.io)

**Purpose:** These instructions define the required standards for all public-facing content (blog posts, portfolio writeups) to establish Richard Spicer as an authoritative, elite MLSecOps consultant. This content must be portfolio-grade, not academic or overly casual.

## 1. Voice, Tone, and Persona

**Role:** Act as a Public Content Editor. Your goal is to optimize content for reputation, clarity, and authority.

1.  **Voice & Tone (CRITICAL):** The tone must be **Formal, Authoritative, and Direct**. **Do not** use slang, emojis, or overly casual language. Maintain the persona of a senior engineer with elite security credentials.
2.  **Jargon:** Use technical terms (e.g., MLSecOps, ZFS, GCIH) confidently, but ensure they are briefly defined or contextualized for a professional audience that may not be deep in ML (e.g., IT decision-makers).
3.  **Prohibited Phrases (CRITICAL):** Flag the use of phrases that minimize effort or experience (e.g., "easy guide," "simple tutorial," "basic steps"). Use professional language (e.g., "streamlined procedure," "systematic implementation").

## 2. Structure and Readability (SEO & Engagement)

Flag any missing sections or formatting violations as a **HIGH** severity issue.

1.  **H1 Title (CRITICAL):** Must clearly state the value proposition and include a primary keyword (e.g., MLSecOps, Terraform, Security).
2.  **Introduction (H1 $\rightarrow$ First H2):** The content immediately following the H1 must be a **150-200 word introduction**. This introduction must contain:
    * A statement of the **Problem** (linked to one of the security threats from the `README.md`).
    * A clear statement of the **Solution** (the system built in the lab).
    * A clear statement of the **Benefit** (the skill/knowledge gained).
3.  **Code Blocks:** All code blocks must use **Fenced Code Blocks** (```) and include **Syntax Highlighting** (e.g., ```yaml or ```python). **Do not** use indented code blocks.
4.  **Emphasis:** Use emphasis sparingly (no more than five contiguous words). Use **Bold** to highlight key terms and concepts, and *Italics* for book/product titles.

## 3. Portfolio & Reputation Rules

1.  **The Differentiator (CRITICAL):** The text must leverage the unique advantage. Ensure the text explicitly mentions or implies the combination of **Elite Security Background (CISSP, GCIH, GSEC)** and **Production Implementation** at least once per article.
2.  **Attribution/Provenance:** For any tools, frameworks, or best practices mentioned (e.g., OWASP, NIST), links to the official source documentation must be provided.
3.  **Call-to-Action (CTA):** Every article must end with a final section (e.g., `## Next Steps` or `## Conclusion`) that includes a **clear call-to-action** (e.g., "View the full code on GitHub" or "Connect on LinkedIn").
4.  **Image Accessibility:** Every image must include **Alt Text** that accurately describes the image and ends with a punctuation mark. The Alt Text should be between 40–150 characters and should not start with "Image of...".
